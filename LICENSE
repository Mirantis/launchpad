Neither party will be liable to the other for damages of any kind solely as a result of terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms, and termination of this Agreement by a party will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of such party under this Agreement or applicable law. Upon the expiration or termination of the Agreement all licenses granted herein will automatically terminate and Customer will discontinue all use of the software and will return to Mirantis any materials (including any copies of software) provided by Mirantis to Customer.

5. Confidentiality. Each party receiving Confidential Information (“Recipient”) from the party disclosing such information (“Discloser”) shall use Confidential Information solely for the purpose of providing and receiving Software and services under this Agreement.  "Confidential Information" means information provided by the Discloser that is reasonably marked as “confidential”, identified as confidential at the time of disclosure, or reasonably known by Recipient to be confidential or should reasonably be expected to be known as confidential. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that the disclosure of the Confidential Information does not confer any license, interest, or rights of any kind in or to the Confidential Information except as provided herein. For 2 years after the termination of this Agreement Recipient shall hold Confidential Information in confidence and not disclose or use the Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, in any form, by any means, or for any purpose.  Recipient shall only disclose the Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, and Affiliates to the extent such persons have a need to know such information for the purposes described in this Agreement, and provided such parties shall be obligated in writing to comply with terms and conditions no less protective than those set forth in this Section.  “Affiliate” means an entity that owns or controls (has the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of management and policies of an entity), is owned or controlled by, or is under the common control or ownership with a part. Recipient shall protect the Confidential Information using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information as Recipient uses to protect its own confidential information.  Recipient shall notify the Discloser in writing immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of these confidentiality obligations and shall reasonably cooperate with the Discloser to regain possession of such Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized use and disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is or becomes generally publicly available through no fault of Recipient, (b) was known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, before its disclosure, (c) becomes known to Recipient, free of any confidentiality obligations, from a source other than Discloser, (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of Confidential Information, (e) is licensed under an open source license, or (f) is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to a requirement of a governmental agency or by operation of law, provided that Recipient shall notify Discloser prior to disclosure (if it can do so without violating any law or rule) in order to give Discloser a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order or similar protection(s).
