* JNesbitt informal todo list

** TODO Move product/mke/api/host.go:Host.MCRConfigure to /pkg/configurer interfaces

The MCRConfigure() method likely exists on the host as a convenience, but as we have common
configurer functionality and the other MCR methods are on the configurer it doesn't belong
on the host.
Another option would be to move functionality to the /pkg/mcr package.

On top of this, the configurer.MCRConfigPath should perhaps be an accessor pair of content,
instead of a filepath.

** TODO Move MCR install script from a pkg/product/phase/download_installer to the windows configurer

The phase is in a weird place, and also is no longer needed for linux installations (we dropped
the linux script usage.)
It should get moved to the Windows configurer and integrated into the Windows configurer MCRInstall().
