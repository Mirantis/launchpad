# Launchpad

Launchpad docs here are focused more on developers. There are excellent [operator guidelines](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/3.8/launchpad.html) available on the main Mirantis documentation portal.

## Purpose

Launchpad is a cli tool designed to assist operations engineers to get the Mirantis MKE3 stack running on provisioned machine nodes.

The tool does not include compute node cluster provisioning, as compute provisioning is too varied to standardize. Launchpad allows machine provisoning to be perfomed in any manner, as long as the resource and networking requirements are met in accortance with the [MKE3 and MCR documentation](https://docs.mirantis.com/mke/3.8/install/predeployment.html).

## Documentation

The following guides should orient any contributer with the design and contribution processes.

1. [Product design guide](design.md)
2. [Product steering and developper guide](developer.md) 
3. [Product usage guide](usage.md)
